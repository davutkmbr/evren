# Phase 21 — The sea: low flight, plunge dives and swimming

Milestone: B · Chill loop · Effort: L · Depends on: 20 (movement; shares skim, breach and flow), water module, fx

Status: planned (requested by the owner on 26 September 2026). Stages 1–2 can start in parallel with phase 20
stage B; stage 4 (underwater rendering) needs GPU review by the owner.

## Goal

Istanbul is a city on the water; the dragon should treat the sea as a place, not a floor. Flying low should change
the water under you, the dragon should be able to plunge in and burst out, and swimming should feel like a big
animal in real waves. All of it calm and optional, and some of it useful to a skilled racer.

## Current state

- **Physics** (`src/dragon/flight/airborne.ts`, `locomotion.ts`): the sea is a flat plane at y = 0. Skimming applies
  hydrodynamic drag, planing lift and spray (`applyWaterSkim`); slow or deep contact turns into `swimming`: a float
  at a fixed depth with a synthetic bob, paddling, splashes; depth is clamped at −2.5 m (no diving). Ground effect
  lift exists below ~60 m.
- **Rendering** (`src/world/water/`): Gerstner waves plus detail bands on the GPU, sea regimes (poyraz / lodos, swell)
  computed per frame on the CPU (`sea-state.ts`), planar reflection. Nothing reacts to the dragon except fx splashes.
- **Life** (`src/world/life/`): ferries, boats and ships with Kelvin wakes (`wakes/`), gulls.
- **Mismatch:** the dragon floats and skims on a flat plane while the rendered surface moves with waves up to a few
  metres in lodos.

## Strand 1 — One sea for physics and pictures

- A CPU wave evaluator that uses the **same** wave set, phases and regime as the shader (`sea-state.ts` already
  computes them in double precision): `heightAt(x, z)`, `normalAt(x, z)`, `velocityAt(x, z)` (orbital velocity),
  plus the Bosphorus surface current (north → south, stronger in the narrows).
- Published through a new `water` service in `contracts.ts` (owned by the water module). Flight, fx, life and the
  camera use it instead of y = 0.
- A headless parity test: sample the CPU evaluator against a JS port of the shader formula at many points and
  times (max error < 2 cm).

## Strand 2 — Flying low over the sea

| Effect | What happens | Where |
|---|---|---|
| **Downwash** | Below ~12 m the wing beats flatten and ruffle a ring of water under the dragon; each downstroke pushes a gust ring outward; spray lifts at the ring's edge in strong beats | water shader: a small dynamic ripple texture (128², ≈ 60 m) that follows the dragon; fx spray |
| **Skim wake** | Skimming (phase 20) leaves a V wake and a foam line that fades; the tail and claws can trail | reuse the vessel wake trails for the dragon |
| **Wingtip vortices** | In a fast low pass, two thin spray curls from the wingtips | fx |
| **Claw dip** | Low and slow over water, L dips the claws (a touch-and-go on the water); in bonito season it can snatch a fish (a moment) | flight + moments |
| **Reactions** | Gulls lift off the water ahead; fish schools flash and scatter under the surface; boats' crews wave | life, moments |
| **Fire on water** | The fire jet hitting the sea throws a steam cloud and a hiss | fx, audio |
| **Sound** | A rushing water layer that grows with low speed over the sea, spray hits, the downwash roar | audio |

Ground-effect lift keeps working and becomes the physical basis of **sıyırma** (phase 20).

## Strand 3 — Plunge dive and breach

- **Plunge ("dalış"):** diving steeply into the sea with folded wings (Shift, aimed down) enters the water instead of
  splashing to a stop: a tall splash column and a crown of spray, a thud and muffled sound, the camera follows
  under. Momentum carries the dragon down 5–15 m depending on entry speed and angle; buoyancy and wing sculling
  bring it back.
- **Under water (a few seconds):** steer with the usual keys, Space strokes (a strong wing sweep), air (stamina)
  drains slowly; bubbles stream from the nostrils; the rider holds on.
- **Breach ("fırlama"):** Space near the surface, or rising fast, bursts out: the body clears the water, the wings snap
  open throwing a sheet of spray, and the dragon climbs away keeping part of its underwater speed. A plunge + breach is
  a flow move (phase 20) and a legitimate way to reverse or change height fast.
- **Safety:** a plunge is refused (with the existing hint) or turns into a hard skim over shallow water (bathymetry
  from geo: the seabed height), near ships, piers and the shore. The dragon never gets stuck: after a time limit or
  at low air it surfaces on its own.

## Strand 4 — Seeing under water (GPU review needed)

- Camera below the surface: underwater fog with depth, a blue-green tint that darkens with depth, light shafts from
  the surface, the surface seen from below (the bright Snell window, refracted sky), floating particles.
- The surface line crossing the camera: a clean split with a thin wet band, droplets on the lens after a breach
  (post pass, short).
- Night: dark water, city lights shimmering from below.
- Budget: ≤ 1 ms GPU on "high" while under water, zero cost above water.

## Strand 5 — Swimming, reworked

- **Rides real waves:** floats on `heightAt`, pitches and rolls with `normalAt`, is carried by the current and by
  passing ferries' wakes (the wake system gives heights too).
- **Gaits:** slow paddle (legs), fast swim (wing sculling with the wings half open, like a cormorant), rest (floating,
  wings folded, head up, occasional shake of the head).
- **Short dive from the surface:** Ctrl ducks under for a few seconds (same under-water rules), Space surfaces.
- **Take-off from water:** a running take-off on the surface: wing beats slapping the water with rows of splashes,
  like a swan, longer in rough seas; or a breach take-off after a dive.
- **Leaving the water:** a shake-off (spray burst from the wings and the neck), a wet sheen on the scales that dries in
  ~20 s (material parameter), drips while flying low.
- **Company:** gulls land on the floating dragon's back; boats give it room (vessel agents treat the swimming dragon
  as an obstacle); anglers on the Galata Bridge react (moments).

## Strand 6 — Weather and the sea

- Lodos: big waves, spray blown off crests, harder water take-offs, the dragon rocks more while swimming.
- Poyraz: choppy, cold light; fog banks sitting on the water in the morning (phase 13).
- Rain: rings on the water; storms: whitecaps everywhere.

## Racing tie-ins

- Water gates close to the surface reward skims; a plunge + breach can shortcut a vertical reversal.
- Flow (phase 20): skim held through a speed ring, a clean breach, a claw dip at a gate count as timing bonuses.

## Controls

| Gesture | Action |
|---|---|
| Shift, steep toward the sea | plunge dive |
| Space under water / near the surface | stroke / breach |
| L low and slow over water | claw dip (touch-and-go on the water) |
| Swimming: Ctrl | duck under |
| Swimming: Space | surface; hold for a water take-off run |

## Tooling and verification

- **Parity test** for the CPU wave evaluator (strand 1).
- **Flight checks** (`movement-check.ts`): skim distance and speed loss; plunge depth vs entry speed and angle;
  breach exit speed and height; water take-off distance per sea state; swim drift in the current; refusals over
  shallow water.
- **Pose strip:** scenarios `swim`, `swim-fast`, `water-takeoff`, `plunge`, `breach`, `claw-dip`, `shake-off`.
- **Owner review on a GPU:** downwash ripples, wakes, spray, steam, the underwater look (strand 4), feel.

## Stages

| Stage | Content | Done when |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Water service with the CPU wave evaluator; dragon floats and skims on real waves; current | Parity test passes; swim/skim checks pass |
| 2 | Low flight: downwash ripples, skim wake, wingtip curls, fire steam, water sound | Owner GPU review OK; budget met |
| 3 | Plunge, under-water movement (camera stays above for now), breach, safety | Plunge/breach checks pass; pose sheets approved; feel test OK |
| 4 | Underwater rendering | Owner GPU review OK; ≤ 1 ms |
| 5 | Swimming rework: gaits, duck under, water take-off run, shake-off, wet sheen, company | Checks and sheets approved; feel test OK |
| 6 | Weather coupling and race/flow tie-ins | Race balance report; feel test OK |

## Risks

- Physics/visual mismatch is worse than no feature: strand 1 comes first and the parity test gates the rest.
- Underwater rendering is GPU-heavy and cannot be judged headless: keep it behind stage 4 and owner review.
- Collisions with ships and piers under water: the collision world has their hulls only above water; add simple
  underwater hull boxes for vessels before stage 3 ships.
